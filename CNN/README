This project deals with building and training a convolutional neural network. 
Training a CNN is studied and the effect of learning rate is analyzed. 
This projects also implements data augmentation to meaningfully increase the volume of training data in order to 
prevent the network from overfitting and to make it more robust. 
Finally, larger and computationally more involved CNNs are designed to deal with the augmented data sets.


DATA:
The dataset used in this project is the ‘Wallpaper Dataset’.
This dataset consists of images of various wallpaper patterns. The images are grayscale images of dimension 256 X 256. 
These images are broadly classified into 17 wallpaper groups. 
Each group contains 1000 images in the training data set and the test data set. 
Thus there are a total of 17,000 image each in the training and test sets.

Files:
