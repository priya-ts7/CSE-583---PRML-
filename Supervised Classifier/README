Main Files:

	starter_ldf - File to implement LDF using Least Squared Error
	starter_knn - File to implement kNN classification using Fisher Projection
	two_class_case - File to demonstrate that Fisher criterion is a special case of least squares, for a 2 class problem.


1) Run 'starter_ldf.m' to obtain classification results using linear discriminant method

Associated Functions:

	loadDataset - To load one of the three given datasets

	learnDiscriminant- To learn the discriminant function for LDF
	classify_ldy - To assign test labels to test set based on learned weights

2) Run 'starter_knn' to obtain classification results using Fisher Projection

Associated Functions:
	
	loadDataset - To load one of the three given dataset

	fisher_Projection - To learn the Fisher weights in order to project the data.
	knnClassify - To classify the projected test data using kNN classifier

3) Run 'two_class_case.m' to obatin the comparison results for the 2 classifiers
