This project deals with performing feature selection and classification on two given data sets. 
Feature Selection is implemnted using two methods: filter and wrapper methods. 
The two approaches are combined to reduce the computational complexity of the prediction model. 
The features selected using the filter and wrapper are then used to train a kNN classifier.
The selected subset of features are visualized and the accuracy of the classifiers are computed for both the given data sets.

Functions:
	rankingfeatures - Performs ranking of features using AVR metric
	featureselect   - Performs Sequential Forward Selection on 'topfeatures' obtained form implementation of filter
	countfeature    - Counts the number of times each feature is selected by filter
	FinalFeatures   - Counts the number of times each feature is selected by wrapper
	
To run Feature Selection for Face data

1) Set Matlab Directory to folder 'My code_Face'.
2) Run starter_code to generate output

To run Feature Selection for EEG data

1) Set Matlab Directory to folder 'My code_EEG'.
2) Run starter_code to generate output
